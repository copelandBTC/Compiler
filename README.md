# Compiler

Over the course of the semester, we were to design different parts of a compiler for a simple programming language our professor created. The file entitled "ASM" is an abstract stack machine that interprets an assembly language (also created by the professor) into binary code. The files contained within "copelandFinal" are the source code for a compiler that translates the professor's language into the machine langauge the abstract stack machine accepts. 

For the ASM, I used Java.

For the final compiler, I used C, Lex for the lexical analysis, and YACC for the syntactic and semantic analysis.
